  Once upon a time, there were two special boys called Cooper and Hugo. Cooper
  and Hugo were special, in part, because they had heart pockets and they knew
  how to use them. You see, heart pockets are a secret pocket inside the heart
  where you can store extra love for when you need it. That way you always have
  a special store of love that you can pull out, and wrap around you like a
  super hero's cape when you are feeling scared, lonely, upset or missing
  someone you love.
